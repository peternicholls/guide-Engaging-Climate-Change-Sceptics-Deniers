# RFC - Engaging with Climate Change Sceptics and Deniers: A Practical Guide

## Preface
This document, including the guide "Engaging with Climate Change Sceptics and Deniers: A Practical Guide," the Request for Comments (RFC) paper, and this preface, was produced with the assistance of ChatGPT-4, an advanced language model developed by OpenAI. ChatGPT-4 is an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that can understand and generate human-like text based on the input it receives.

To give a brief overview, ChatGPT-4 is part of a class of AI models known as large-scale language models. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data, enabling them to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses to various prompts or questions. ChatGPT-4 has been designed to be highly adaptable and capable of generating content across a wide range of topics and formats.

In the process of creating this document, we provided ChatGPT-4 with a series of prompts and guidance to generate the content. The AI model then produced text that was structured, evidence-based, and relevant to the topic at hand. It is important to note that while ChatGPT-4 is a powerful tool, it is not infallible and may require human supervision and editing to ensure the highest quality output.

Throughout the development of this document, we have carefully reviewed the content generated by ChatGPT-4 to ensure accuracy and appropriateness. However, as with any complex document, there may still be room for improvement or clarification. We welcome feedback from readers, not only to improve the content of the guide but also to better understand the potential and limitations of AI-generated content like that produced by ChatGPT-4.

We hope that by leveraging the power of ChatGPT-4 in the creation of this guide and RFC paper, we have provided a valuable resource for engaging with climate change sceptics and deniers. Additionally, we believe that this project serves as an example of the potential applications of AI technologies like ChatGPT-4 in addressing complex and pressing global challenges.


## Abstract
This Request for Comments (RFC) paper introduces a practical guide for effectively engaging with climate change sceptics and deniers. The guide is based on evidence from the fields of communication, psychology, and climate change research, and is designed to be accessible and easy to use, with clearly defined sections for quick reference. The purpose of this RFC is to seek feedback and suggestions for improvement from the scientific and practitioner communities to further enhance the guide's effectiveness and relevance.

## The Guide and Content
The guide will be view availale soon. 

## Request for Feedback and Suggestions
We invite researchers, practitioners, and other stakeholders to review the guide and provide feedback and suggestions for improvement. We are particularly interested in the following:
1. Recommendations for additional evidence-based strategies and techniques that could be incorporated into the guide.
2. Suggestions for refining or reorganising the guide's structure to improve its usability and effectiveness.
3. Identification of any gaps or omissions in the guide's content or scope.
4. Feedback on the guide's clarity, accessibility, and relevance to different audiences.
5. Identification of any errors, corrections of factual inaccuracies, or incorrect references and sources that should be addressed.

Please provide your corrections, comments, feedback, and suggestions as pull requests or however appropriate.

## Conclusion
This RFC paper presents the guide "Engaging with Climate Change Sceptics and Deniers: A Practical Guide" and seeks feedback from the scientific and practitioner communities to enhance its effectiveness and relevance. By incorporating this feedback, we aim to create a comprehensive and practical resource for climate change communicators to foster understanding and promote constructive dialogue with climate change sceptics and deniers.
